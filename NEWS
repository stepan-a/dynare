Announcement for Dynare 4.5.0 (on 2013-12-16)
=============================================

We are pleased to announce the release of Dynare 4.5.0.

This major release adds new features and fixes various bugs.

The Windows packages are already available for download at:

 http://www.dynare.org/download/dynare-stable

The Mac and Debian/Ubuntu packages should follow soon.

All users are strongly encouraged to upgrade.

This release is compatible with MATLAB versions ranging from 7.3 (R2006b) to
9.2 (R2017a) and with GNU Octave version 4.2.

Here is the list of major user-visible changes:



Dynare 4.5
==========


 - Ramsey policy

   + Added command `ramsey_model` that builds the expanded model with
     FOC conditions for the planner's problem but doesn't perform any
     computation. Usefull to compute Ramsey policy in a perfect
     foresight model,

   + `ramsey_policy` accepts multipliers in its variable list and
     displays results for them.


 - Perfect foresight models

   + New commands `perfect_foresight_setup` (for preparing the
     simulation) and `perfect_foresight_solver` (for computing it). The
     old `simul` command still exist and is now an alias for
     `perfect_foresight_setup` + `perfect_foresight_solver`. It is no
     longer possible to manipulate by hand the contents of
     `oo_.exo_simul` when using `simul`. People who want to do
     it must first call `perfect_foresight_setup`, then do the
     manipulations, then call `perfect_foresight_solver`,

   + By default, the perfect foresight solver will try a homotopy
     method if it fails to converge at the first try. The old behavior
     can be restored with the `no_homotopy` option,

   + New option `stack_solve_algo=7` that allows specifying a
     `solve_algo` solver for solving the model,

   + New option `solve_algo` that allows specifying a solver for
     solving the model when using `stack_solve_algo=7`,

   + New option `lmmcp` that solves the model via a Levenberg-Marquardt
     mixed complementarity problem (LMMCP) solver,

   + New option `robust_lin_solve` that triggers the use of a robust
     linear solver for the default `solve_algo=4`,

   + New options `tolf` and `tolx` to control termination criteria of
     solvers,

   + New option `endogenous_terminal_period` to `simul`,

   + Added the possibility to set the initial condition of the
     (stochastic) extended path simulations with the histval block.


 - Optimal simple rules

   + Saves the optimal value of parameters to `oo_.osr.optim_params`,

   + New block `osr_params_bounds` allows specifying bounds for the
     estimated parameters,

   + New option `opt_algo` allows selecting different optimizers while
     the new option `optim` allows specifying the optimizer options,

   + The `osr` command now saves the names, bounds, and indices for the
     estimated parameters as well as the indices and weights of the
     variables entering the objective function into `M_.osr`.


 - Forecasts and Smoothing

   + The smoother and forecasts take uncertainty about trends and means
     into account,

   + Forecasts accounting for measurement error are now saved in fields
     of the form `HPDinf_ME` and `HPDsup_ME`,

   + New fields `oo_.Smoother.Trend` and `oo_.Smoother.Constant` that
     save the trend and constant parts of the smoothed variables,

     added,

   + New option `posterior_nograph` that suppresses the generation of
     graphs associated with Bayesian IRFs, posterior smoothed objects,
     and posterior forecasts,

* Bugs and problems identified in version 4.4.3 and that have been fixed in version 4.5.0:


 - BVAR models

   + `bvar_irf` could display IRFs in an unreadable way when they moved from
     negative to positive values,

   + In contrast to what is stated in the documentation, the confidence interval
     size `conf_sig` was 0.6 by default instead of 0.9.


 - Conditional forecasts

   + The `conditional_forecast` command produced wrong results in calibrated
     models when used at initial values outside of the steady state (given with
     `initval`),

   + The `plot_conditional_forecast` option could produce unreadable figures if
     the areas overlap,

   + The `conditional_forecast` command after MLE crashed,

   + In contrast to what is stated in the manual, the confidence interval size
     `conf_sig` was 0.6 by default instead of 0.8.

   + Conditional forecasts were wrong when the declaration of endogenous
     variables was not preceeding the declaration of the exogenous
     variables and parameters.


 - Discretionary policy

   + Dynare allowed running models where the number of instruments did not match
     the number of omitted equations,

   + Dynare could crash in some cases when trying to display the solution,

   + Parameter dependence embedded via a `steady_state` was not taken into
     account, typically resulting in crashes.

 - dseries class

   + When subtracting a dseries object from a number, the number was instead
     subtracted from the dseries object.


 - DSGE-VAR models

   + Dynare crashed when estimation encountered non-finite values in the Jacobian
     at the steady state,

   + The presence of a constant was not considered for degrees of freedom
     computation of the Gamma function used during the posterior computation; due
     to only affecting the constant term, results should be be unaffected, except
     for model_comparison when comparing models with and without.


 - Estimation command

   + In contrast to what was stated in the manual, the confidence interval size
     `conf_sig` for `forecast` without MCMC was 0.6 by default instead of 0.9,

   + Calling estimation after identification could lead to crashes,

   + When using recursive estimation/forecasting and setting some elements of
     `nobs` to be larger than the number of observations T in the data,
     `oo_recursive_` contained additional cell entries that simply repeated the
     results obtained for `oo_recursive_T`,

   + Computation of Bayesian smoother could crash for larger models when
     requesting `forecast` or `filtered_variables`,

   + Geweke convergence diagnostics were not computed on the full MCMC chain when
     the `load_mh_file` option was used,

   + The Geweke convergence diagnostics always used the default `taper_steps` and
   `geweke_interval`,

   + Bayesian IRFs (`bayesian_irfs` option) could be displayed in an unreadable
     way when they move from negative to positive values,

   + If `bayesian_irfs` was requested when `mh_replic` was too low to compute
     HPDIs, plotting was crashing,

   + The x-axis value in `oo_.prior_density` for the standard deviation and
     correlation of measurement errors was written into a field
     `mearsurement_errors_*` instead of `measurement_errors_*`,

   + Using a user-defined `mode_compute` crashed estimation,

   + Option `mode_compute=10` did not work with infinite prior bounds,

   + The posterior variances and covariances computed by `moments_varendo` were
     wrong for very large models due to a matrix erroneously being filled up with
     zeros,

   + Using the `forecast` option with `loglinear` erroneously added the unlogged
     steady state,

   + When using the `loglinear` option the check for the presence of a constant
     was erroneously based on the unlogged steady state,

   + Estimation of `observation_trends` was broken as the trends specified as a
     function of deep parameters were not correctly updated during estimation,

   + When using `analytic_derivation`, the parameter values were not set before
     testing whether the steady state file changes parameter values, leading to
     subsequent crashes,

   + If the steady state of an initial parameterization did not solve, the
     observation equation could erroneously feature no constant when the
     `use_calibration` option was used,

   + When computing posterior moments, Dynare falsely displayed that moment
     computations are skipped, although the computation was performed correctly,

   + If `conditional_variance_decomposition` was requested, although all
     variables contain unit roots, Dynare crashed instead of providing an error
     message,

   + Computation of the posterior parameter distribution was erroneously based
     on more draws than specified (there was one additional draw for every Markov
     chain),

   + The estimation option `lyapunov=fixed_point` was broken,

   + Computation of `filtered_vars` with only one requested step crashed Dynare,

   + Option `kalman_algo=3` was broken with non-diagonal measurement error,

   + When using the diffuse Kalman filter with missing observations, an additive
     factor log(2*pi) was missing in the last iteration step,

   + Passing of the `MaxFunEvals` and `InitialSimplexSize` options to
     `mode_compute=8` was broken,

   + Bayesian forecasts contained initial conditions and had the wrong length in
     both plots and stored variables,

   + Filtered variables obtained with `mh_replic=0`, ML, or
     `calibrated_smoother` were padded with zeros at the beginning and end and
     had the wrong length in stored variables,

   + Computation of smoothed measurement errors in Bayesian estimation was broken,

   + The `selected_variables_only` option (`mh_replic=0`, ML, or
     `calibrated_smoother`) returned wrong results for smoothed, updated, and
     filtered variables,

   + Combining the `selected_variables_only` option with forecasts obtained
     using `mh_replic=0`, ML, or `calibrated_smoother` leaded to crashes,

   + `oo_.UpdatedVariables` was only filled when the `filtered_vars` option was specified,

   + When using Bayesian estimation with `filtered_vars`, but without
     `smoother`, then `oo_.FilteredVariables` erroneously also contained filtered
     variables at the posterior mean as with `mh_replic=0`,

   + Running an MCMC a second time in the same folder with a different number of
     iterations could result in crashes due to the loading of stale files,

   + Results displayed after Bayesian estimation when not specifying
     the `smoother` option were based on the parameters at the mode
     from mode finding instead of the mean parameters from the
     posterior draws. This affected the smoother results displayed, but
     also calls to subsequent command relying on the parameters stored
     in `M_.params` like `stoch_simul`,

   + The content of `oo_.posterior_std` after Bayesian estimation was based on
     the standard deviation at the posterior mode, not the one from the MCMC, this
     was not consistent with the reference manual,

   + When the initialization of an MCMC run failed, the metropolis.log file was
     locked, requiring a restart of Matlab to restart estimation,

   + If the posterior mode was right at the corner of the prior bounds, the
     initialization of the MCMC erroneously crashed,

   + If the number of dropped draws via `mh_drop` coincided with the number of
     draws in a `_mh'-file`, `oo_.posterior.metropolis.mean` and
     `oo_.posterior.metropolis.Variance` were NaN.


 - Estimation and calibrated smoother

   + When using `observation_trends` with the `prefilter` option, the mean shift
     due to the trend was not accounted for,

   + When using `first_obs`>1, the higher trend starting point of
     `observation_trends` was not taken into account, leading, among other things,
     to problems in recursive forecasting,

   + The diffuse Kalman smoother was crashing if the forecast error variance
     matrix becomes singular,

   + The multivariate Kalman smoother provided incorrect state estimates when
     all data for one observation are missing,

   + The multivariate diffuse Kalman smoother provided incorrect state estimates
     when the `Finf` matrix becomes singular,

   + The univariate diffuse Kalman filter was crashing if the initial covariance
     matrix of the nonstationary state vector is singular,


 - Forecats

   + In contrast to what is stated in the manual, the confidence interval size
     `conf_sig` was 0.6 by default instead of 0.9.

   + Forecasting with exogenous deterministic variables provided wrong decision
     rules, yielding wrong forecasts.

   + Forecasting with exogenous deterministic variables crashed when the
     `periods` option was not explicitly specified,

   + Option `forecast` when used with `initval` was using the initial values in
     the `initval` block and not the steady state computed from these initial
     values as the starting point of forecasts.


 - Global Sensitivity Analysis

   + Sensitivity with ML estimation could result in crashes,

   + Option `mc` must be forced if `neighborhood_width` is used,

   + Fixed dimension of `stock_logpo` and `stock_ys`,

   + Incomplete variable initialization could lead to crashes with `prior_range=1`.


 - Indentification

   + Identification did not correctly pass the `lik_init` option,
     requiring the manual setting of `options_.diffuse_filter=1` in
     case of unit roots,

   + Testing identification of standard deviations as the only
     parameters to be estimated with ML leaded to crashes,

   + Automatic increase of the lag number for autocovariances when the
     number of parameters is bigger than the number of non-zero moments
     was broken,

   + When using ML, the asymptotic Hessian was not computed,

   + Checking for singular values when the eigenvectors contained only
     one column did not work correctly,


 - Model comparison

   + Selection of the `modifiedharmonicmean` estimator was broken,


 - Optimal Simple Rules

   + When covariances were specified, variables that only entered with
     their variance and no covariance term obtained a wrong weight,
     resulting in wrong results,

   + Results reported for stochastic simulations after `osr` were based
     on the last parameter vector encountered during optimization,
     which does not necessarily coincide with the optimal parameter
     vector,

   + Using only one (co)variance in the objective function resulted in crashes,

   + For models with non-stationary variables the objective function was computed wrongly.


 - Ramsey policy

   + If a Lagrange multiplier appeared in the model with a lead or a lag
     of more than one period, the steady state could be wrong.

   + When using an external steady state file, incorrect steady states
     could be accepted,

   + When using an external steady state file with more than one
     instrument, Dynare crashed,

   + When using an external steady state file and running `stoch_simul`
     after `ramsey_planner`, an incorrect steady state was used,

   + When the number of instruments was not equal to the number of
     omitted equations, Dynare crashed with a cryptic message,

   + The `planner_objective` accepted `varexo`, but ignored them for computations,


 - Shock decomposition

   + Did not work with the `parameter_set=calibration` option if an
     `estimated_params` block is present,

   + Crashed after MLE.


 - Perfect foresight models

   + The perfect foresight solver could accept a complex solution
     instead of continuing to look for a real-valued one,

   + The `initval_file` command only accepted column and not row vectors,

   + The `initval_file` command did not work with Excel files,

   + Deterministic simulations with one boundary condition crashed in
     `solve_one_boundary` due to a missing underscore when passing
     `options_.simul.maxit`,

   + Deterministic simulation with exogenous variables lagged by more
     than one period crashed,

   + Termination criterion `maxit` was hard-coded for `solve_algo=0`
     and could no be changed,

   + When using `block`/`bytecode`, relational operators could not be enforced,

   + When using `block` some exceptions were not properly handled,
     leading to code crashes,

   + Using `periods=1` crashed the solver (bug only partially fixed).


 - Smoothing

   + The univariate Kalman smoother returned wrong results when used
     with correlated measurement error,

   + The diffuse smoother sometimes returned linear combinations of the
     smoothed stochastic trend estimates instead of the original trend
     estimates.

 - Perturbation reduced form

   + In contrast to what is stated in the manual, the results of the
     unconditional variance decomposition were only stored in
     `oo_.gamma_y(nar+2)`, not in `oo_.variance_decomposition`,

   + Dynare could crash when the steady state could not be computed
     when using the `loglinear` option,

   + Using `bytcode` when declared exogenous variables were not
     used in the model leaded to crashes in stochastic simulations,

   + Displaying decision rules involving lags of auxiliary variables of
     type 0 (leads>1) crashed.

   + The `relative_irf` option resulted in wrong output at `order>1` as
     it implicitly relies on linearity.


 - Displaying of the MH-history with the `internals` command crashed
   if parameter names did not have same length.

 - Dynare crashed when the user-defined steady state file returned an
   error code, but not an conformable-sized steady state vector.

 - Due to a bug in `mjdgges.mex` unstable parameter draws with
   eigenvalues up to 1+1e-6 could be accepted as stable for the
   purpose of the Blanchard-Kahn conditions, even if `qz_criterium<1`.

 - The `use_dll` option on Octave for Windows required to pass a
   compiler flag at the command line, despite the manual stating this
   was not necessary.

 - Dynare crashed for models with `block` option if the Blanchard-Kahn
   conditions were not satisfied instead of generating an error
   message.

 - The `verbose` option did not work with `model(block)`.

 - When falsely specifying the `model(linear)` for nonlinear models,
   incorrect steady states were accepted instead of aborting.

 - The `STEADY_STATE` operator called on model local variables
   (so-called pound variables) did not work as expected.

 - The substring operator in macro-processor was broken. The
   characters of the substring could be mixed with random characters
   from the memory space.

 - Block decomposition could sometimes cause the preprocessor to crash.

 - A bug when external functions were used in model local variables
   that were contained in equations that required auxiliary
   variable/equations led to crashes of Matlab.

 - Sampling from the prior distribution for an inverse gamma II
   distribution when `prior_trunc>0` could result in incorrect
   sampling.

 - Sampling from the prior distribution for a uniform distribution
   when `prior_trunc>0` was ignoring the prior truncation.

 - Conditional forecasts were wrong when the declaration of endogenous
   variables was not preceeding the declaration of the exogenous
   variables and parameters.

The Mac and GNU/Linux packages (for Debian and Ubuntu LTS) should follow soon.

This release is compatible with MATLAB versions 7.3 (R2006b) to 8.2 (R2013b)
and with GNU Octave versions 3.6 to 3.8.

Here is a list of the problems identified in version 4.4.2 and that have been
fixed in version 4.4.3:

 - When loading a dataset in XLS, XLSX or CSV format, the first
   observation was discarded.

 - Reading data in an Excel-file with only one variable wasz leading
   to a crash.

 - When using the k_order_perturbation option (which is implicit at
   3rd order) without the use_dll option, crashes or unexpected
   behavior could happen if some 2nd or 3rd derivative evaluates to
   zero (while not being symbolically zero)

 - When using external function, Ramsey policy could crash or return
   wrong results.

 - For Ramsey policy, the equation numbers associated with the
   Lagrange multipliers stored in M_.aux_vars were erroneously one too
   low

 - When updating deep parameters in the steady state file, the changes
   were not fully taken into account (this was only affecting the
   Ramsey policy).

 - When using external functions and the bytecode option, wrong
   results were returned (if second order derivates of the external
   functions were needed).

 - The confidence level for computations in estimation, conf_sig could
   not be changed and was fixed at 0.9. The new option mh_conf_sig is
   now used to set this interval

 - Conditional forecasts with non-diagonal covariance matrix used an
   incorrect decomposition of the covariance matrix. A Cholesky
   factorization is used.

 - Option geweke_interval was not effective, Dynare always defaulted
   to the standard value.

 - The mode_file option lacked backward compatibility with older
   Dynare versions.

 - Loading an mh_mode file with the mode_file option was broken.

 - Using identification with var_exo_det leaded to crashes (the
   preprocessor now returns an error if they are used simultaneously)

 - The identification command did not print results if the initial
   parameter set was invalid and then crashed later on if the MC
   sample is bigger than 1

 - Inconsistencies between static and dynamic models leaded to crashes
   instead of error messages (only with block option).

 - The use of external functions crashed the preprocessor when the
   derivatives of the external function are explicitly called in the
   model block. The preprocessor now forbids the use of external
   functions derivates in the model block.

 - Using the block option when a variable does not appear in the
   current period crashed Dynare instead of providing an error
   message.


Announcement for Dynare 4.4.2 (on 2014-03-04)
=============================================

We are pleased to announce the release of Dynare 4.4.2.

This is a bugfix release.

The Windows packages are already available for download at:

 http://www.dynare.org/download/dynare-stable

The Mac and GNU/Linux packages (for Debian and Ubuntu LTS) should follow soon.

This release is compatible with MATLAB versions 7.3 (R2006b) to 8.2 (R2013b)
and with GNU Octave versions 3.6 to 3.8.

Here is a list of the problems identified in version 4.4.1 and that have been
fixed in version 4.4.2:

 - Geweke convergence diagnostics was computed on the wrong sample if `mh_drop'
   was not equal to the default of 0.5.

 - The `loglinear' option of `stoch_simul' was displaying the steady state of
   the original values, not the logged ones, and was producing incorrect
   simulations and simulated moments. Theoretical moments were unaffected.

 - The `optim' option of `estimation (for setting options to `mode_compute')
   was only working with at least MATLAB 8.1 (R2013a) or Octave 3.8.

 - For unit root models, theoretical HP filtered moments were sometimes
   erroneously displayed as NaN.

 - Specifying an endogenous variable twice after the `estimation' command would
   lead to a crash in the computation of moments.

 - Deterministic simulations were crashing on some models with more than one
   lead or one lag on exogenous variables.

 - Homotopy in stochastic extended path with order greater than 0 was not
   working correctly (during the homotopy steps the perfect foresight model
   solver was called instead of the stochastic perfect foresight model solver).

 - MCMC convergence diagnostics were not computed if `mh_replic' was less than
   2000; the test now relies on the total number of iterations (this only makes
   a difference if option `load_mh_file' is used).


Announcement for Dynare 4.4.1 (on 2014-01-17)
=============================================

We are pleased to announce the release of Dynare 4.4.1.

This release contains a few changes to the user interface and fixes various
bugs. It also adds compatibility with Octave 3.8.

The Windows packages are already available for download at:

 http://www.dynare.org/download/dynare-stable

The Mac and GNU/Linux packages (for Debian and Ubuntu) should follow soon.

All users are encouraged to upgrade.

This release is compatible with MATLAB versions 7.3 (R2006b) to 8.2 (R2013b) and
with GNU Octave versions 3.6 to 3.8.

* Changes to the user interface:

 - The syntax introduced in 4.4.0 for conditional forecast in a deterministic
   setup was removed, and replaced by a new one that is better suited to the
   task. More precisely, such deterministic forecasts are no longer done using
   the `conditional_forecast' command. The latter is replaced by a group of
   commands: `init_plan', `basic_plan' and `flip_plan'. See the reference
   manual for more details.

 - Changes to the reporting module: option `annualAverages' to `addTable' has
   been removed (use option `tableDataRhs' to `addSeries' instead); option
   `vlineAfter' to `addTable' now also accepts a cell array.

 - Changes to the date and time series classes: implement broadcasting for
   operations (+,-,* and /) between `dseries' class and scalar or vectors; add
   the possibility of selecting an observation within a time series using a
   formatted string containing a date.

* Bugs and problems identified in version 4.4.0 and that have been fixed in
  version 4.4.1:

 - In MS-SBVAR, there was a bug preventing the computation of impulse responses
   on a constant regime.

 - Under Octave, after modifying the MOD file, the changes were not taken into
   account at the first Dynare run, but only at the second run.


Announcement for Dynare 4.4.0 (on 2013-12-16)
=============================================

We are pleased to announce the release of Dynare 4.4.0.

This major release adds new features and fixes various bugs.

The Windows packages are already available for download at:

 http://www.dynare.org/download/dynare-stable

The Mac and Debian/Ubuntu packages should follow soon.

All users are strongly encouraged to upgrade.

This release is compatible with MATLAB versions ranging from 7.3 (R2006b) to
8.2 (R2013b) and with GNU Octave version 3.6.

Here is the list of major user-visible changes:


* New major algorithms:

 - Extended path at order 1 and above, also known as “stochastic extended
   path”. This method is triggered by setting the `order' option of the
   `extended_path' command to a value greater than 0. Dynare will then use a
   Gaussian quadrature to take into account the effects of future uncertainty.
   The time series for the endogenous variables are generated by assuming that
   the agents believe that there will no more shocks after period t+order.

 - Alternative algorithms for computing decision rules of a stochastic model,
   based on the cycle reduction and logarithmic reduction algorithms. These
   methods are respectively triggered by giving `dr = cycle_reduction' or 'dr
   = logarithmic_reduction' as an option to the `stoch_simul' command.

 - Pruning now works with 3rd order approximation, along the lines of
   Andreasen, Fernández-Villaverde and Rubio-Ramírez (2013).

 - Computation of conditional forecast using an extended path method. This is
   triggered by the new option `simulation_type = deterministic' in the
   `conditional_forecast' command. In this case, the `expectation' command in
   the `conditional_forecast_paths' block has to be used to indicate the nature
   of expectations (whether shocks are a surprise or are perfectly
   anticipated).

 - Endogenous priors as in Christiano, Trabandt and Walentin (2011). Those are
   triggered by the new option `endogenous_prior' of the `estimation' command.


* Other algorithmic improvements:

 - New command `model_diagnostics' to perform various sanity checks on the
   model. Note: in the past, some users may have used a preliminary MATLAB
   function implementing this; the new command has the same syntax, except that
   you shouldn't pass any argument to it.

 - Terminal conditions of perfect foresight simulations can now be specified in
   growth rates. More specifically, the new option `differentiate_forward_vars'
   of the `model' block will create auxiliary forward looking variables
   expressed in first differences or growth rates of the actual forward looking
   variables defined in the model. These new variables have obvious zero
   terminal conditions whatever the simulation context and this in many cases
   helps convergence of simulations.

 - Convergence diagnostics for single chain MCMC à la Geweke (1992, 1999).

 - New optimizer for the posterior mode (triggered by `mode_compute=10'): it
   uses the simpsa algorithm, based on the combination of the non-linear
   simplex and simulated annealing algorithms and proposed by Cardoso, Salcedo
   and Feyo de Azevedo (1996).

 - The automatic detrending engine has been extended to work on models written
   in logs. The corresponding trend variable type is `log_trend_var', and the
   corresponding deflator type is `log_deflator'.


* New features in the user interface:

 - New set of functions for easily creating PDF reports including figures and
   tables. See the “Reporting” section in the reference manual for more
   details.

 - New MATLAB/Octave classes for handling time series. See the “Time series”
   section in the reference manual for more details.

 - Datafiles in CSV format can now be used for estimation.

 - New macro processor `length' operator, returns the length of an array.

 - New option `all_values_required' of `initval' and `endval' blocks: enforces
   initialization of all endogenous and exogenous variables within the block.

 - Option `ar' can now be given to the `estimation' command.

 - New options `nograph', `nointeractive' and `nowarn' to the `dynare' command,
   for a better control of what is displayed.

 - New option `nostrict' to the `dynare' command, for allowing Dynare to
   continue processing when there are more endogenous variables than equations
   or when an undeclared symbol is assigned in `initval' or `endval'.

 - The information on MCMC acceptance rates, seeds, last log posterior
   likelihood, and last parameter draw are now saved on the disk and can
   be displayed with `internals --display-mh-history' or loaded into the
   workspace with `internals --load-mh-history'.

 - New options `mode_check_neighbourhood_size', `mode_check_symmetric_plots'
   and `mode_check_number_of_points', for a better control of the diagnostic
   plots.

 - New option `parallel_local_files' of `model' block, for transferring extra
   files during parallel computations.

 - New option `clock' of `set_dynare_seed', for setting a different seed at
   each run.

 - New option `qz_zero_threshold' of the `check', `stoch_simul' and
   `estimation' commands, for a better control of the situation where a
   generalized eigenvalue is close to 0/0.

 - New `verbatim' block for inclusion of text that should pass through the
   preprocessor and be placed as is in the `modfile.m' file.

 - New option `mcmc_jumping_covariance' of the `estimation' command, for a
   better control of the covariance matrix used for the proposal density of the
   MCMC sampler.

 - New option `use_calibration' of the `estimated_params_init', for using the
   calibration of deep parameters and the elements of the covariance matrix
   specified in the `shocks' block as starting values for the estimation.

 - New option `save_draws' of the `ms_simulation' command.

 - New option `irf_plot_threshold' of the `stoch_simul' and `estimation'
   commands, for a better control of the display of IRFs which are almost nil.

 - New option `long_name' for endogenous, exogenous and parameter declarations,
   which can be used to declare a long name for variables. That long name can
   be programmatically retrieved in `M_.endo_names_long'.


* Miscellaneous changes

 - The deciles of some posterior moments were erroneously saved in a field
   `Distribution' under `oo_'. This field is now called `deciles', for
   consistency with other posterior moments and with the manual. Similarly, the
   fields `Mean', `Median', `HPDsup', `HPDinf', and `Variance' are now
   consistently capitalized.

 - The console mode now implies the `nodisplay' option.


* Bugs and problems identified in version 4.3.3 and that have been fixed in
  version 4.4.0:

 - In an `endval' block, auxiliary variables were not given the right value.
   This would not result in wrong results, but could prevent convergence of
   the steady state computation.

 - Deterministic simulations with `stack_solve_algo=0' (the default value) were
   crashing if some exogenous had a lag strictly greater than 1.

 - When using the `mode_file' option, the initial estimation checks were not
   performed for the loaded mode, but for the original starting values. Thus,
   potential prior violations by the mode only appeared during estimation,
   leading to potentially cryptic crashes and error messages.

 - If a shock/measurement error variance was set to 0 in calibration, the
   correlation matrix featured a 0 instead of a 1 on the diagonal, leading to
   wrong estimation results.

 - In the presence of calibrated covariances, estimation did not enforce
   positive definiteness of the covariance matrix.

 - Estimation using the `diffuse_filter' option together with the univariate
   Kalman filter and a diagonal measurement error matrix was broken.

 - A purely backward model with `k_order_solver' was leading to crashes of
   MATLAB/Octave.

 - Non-linear estimation was not skipping the specified presample when
   computing the likelihood.

 - IRFs and theoretical moments at order > 1 were broken for purely
   forward-looking models.

 - Simulated moments with constant variables was leading to crashes when
   displaying autocorrelations.

 - The `osr' command was sometimes crashing with cryptic error messages because
   of some unaccounted error codes returned from a deeper routine.

 - The check for stochastic singularity during initial estimation checks was
   broken.

 - Recursive estimation starting with the pathological case of `nobs=1' was
   crashing.

 - Conditional variance decomposition within or after estimation was crashing
   when at least one shock had been calibrated to zero variance.

 - The `estimated_params_init' and `estimated_params_bounds' blocks were broken
   for correlations.

 - The `filter_step_ahead' option was not producing any output in Bayesian
   estimation.

 - Deterministic simulations were sometimes erroneously indicating convergence
   although the residuals were actually NaN or Inf.

 - Supplying a user function in the `mode_compute' option was leading to
   a crash.

 - Deterministic simulation of models without any exogenous variable was
   crashing.

 - The MS-SBVAR code was not updating files between runs on Windows. This means
   that if a MOD file was updated between runs in the same folder and a
   `file_tag' was not changed, then the results would not change.

 - The `ramsey_policy' command was not putting in `oo_.planner_objective_value'
   the value of the planner objective at the optimum.

Announcement for Dynare 4.3.0 (on 2012-06-15)
=============================================

We are pleased to announce the release of Dynare 4.3.0. This major release adds
new features and fixes various bugs.

The new release is compatible with MATLAB versions ranging from 7.0 (R14) to
7.14 (R2012a) and with GNU Octave versions ranging from 3.2 to 3.6.

Here is the list of the main user-visible changes:


* New major algorithms:

 - Nonlinear estimation with a particle filter based on a second order
   approximation of the model, as in Fernández-Villaverde and Rubio-Ramírez
   (2005); this is triggered by setting `order=2' in the `estimation' command

 - Extended path solution method as in Fair and Taylor (1983); see the
   `extended_path' command

 - Support for Markov-Switching Structural Bayesian VARs (MS-SBVAR) along the
   lines of Sims, Waggoner and Zha (2008) (see the dedicated section in the
   reference manual)

   `discretionary_policy' command

 - Identification analysis along the lines of Iskrev (2010); see the
   `identification' command

 - The Global Sensitivity Analysis toolbox (Ratto, 2008) is now part of the
   official Dynare distribution


* Other algorithmic improvements:

   (with the `block' option of `model'; only at 1st order)

 - Possibility of running smoother and filter on a calibrated model; see the
   `calib_smoother' command

 - Possibility of doing conditional forecast on a calibrated model; see the
   `parameter_set=calibration' option of the `conditional_forecast' command

 - The default algorithm for deterministic simulations has changed and is now
   based on sparse matrices; the historical algorithm (Laffargue, Boucekkine
   and Juillard) is still available under the `stack_solve_algo=6'option of the
   `simul' command

 - Possibility of using an analytic gradient for the estimation; see the
   `analytic_derivation' option of the `estimation' command

 - Implementation of the Nelder-Mead simplex based optimization routine for
   computing the posterior mode; available under the `mode_compute=8' option of
   the `estimation' command

 - Implementation of the CMA Evolution Strategy algorithm for computing the
   posterior mode; available under the `mode_compute=9' option of the
   `estimation' command

 - New solvers for Lyapunov equations which can accelerate the estimation of
   large models; see the `lyapunov' option of the `estimation' command

 - New solvers for Sylvester equations which can accelerate the resolution of
   large models with block decomposition; see the `sylvester' option of the
   `stoch_simul' and `estimation' commands

 - The `ramsey_policy' command now displays the planner objective value
   function under Ramsey policy and stores it in `oo_.planner_objective_value'

 - Theoretical autocovariances are now computed when the `block' option is
   present

 - The `linear' option is now compatible with the `block' and `bytecode'
   options

 - The `loglinear' option now works with purely backward or forward models at
   first order


* New features in the user interface:

 - New mathematical primitives allowed in model block: `abs()', `sign()'

 - The behavior with respect to graphs has changed:

    + By default, Dynare now displays graphs and saves them to disk in EPS
      format only

    + The format can be changed to PDF or FIG with the new `graph_format'
      option

    + It is possible to save graphs to disk without displaying them with the
      new `nodisplay' option

 - New `nocheck' option to the `steady' command: tells not to check the steady
   state and accept values given by the user (useful for models with unit
   roots)

 - A series of deterministic shocks can be passed as a pre-defined vector in
   the `values' statement of a `shocks' block

 - New option `sub_draws' in the `estimation' command for controlling the
   number of draws used in computing the posterior distributions of various
   objects

 - New macroprocessor command `@#ifdef' for testing if a macro-variable is
   defined

 - New option `irf_shocks' of the `stoch_simul' command, to allow IRFs to be
   created only for certain exogenous variables

   in the cluster and of creating clusters comprised of nodes with different
   operating systems (see the relevant section in the reference manual)

 - It is now possible to redefine a parameter in the `steady_state_model' block
   (use with caution)

 - New option `maxit' in the `simul' and `steady' commands to determine the
   maximum number of iterations of the nonlinear solver

 - New option `homotopy_force_continue' in the `steady' command to control the
   behavior when a homotopy fails

 - Possibility of globally altering the defaults of options by providing a file
   in the `GlobalInitFile' field of the configuration file (use with caution)

 - New option `nolog' to the `dynare' command line to avoid creating a logfile

 - New option `-D' to the `dynare' command line with for defining
   macro-variables


* Miscellaneous changes:

 - The `use_dll' option of `model' now creates a MEX file for the static model
   in addition to that for the dynamic model

 - The `unit_root_vars' command is now obsolete; use the `diffuse_filter'
   option of the `estimation' command instead

 - New option `--burn' to Dynare++ to discard initial simulation points

 - New top-level MATLAB/Octave command `internals' for internal documentation
   and unitary tests


* Bugs and problems identified in version 4.2.5 and that have been fixed in
  version 4.3.0:

 - Backward models with the `loglinear' option were incorrectly handled

 - Solving for hyperparameters of inverse gamma priors was sometimes crashing

 - The deterministic solver for purely forward models was broken

 - When running `estimation' or `identification' on models with non-diagonal
   structural error covariance matrices, while not simultaneously estimating
   the correlation between shocks (i.e. calibrating the correlation), the
   off-diagonal elements were incorrectly handled or crashes were occuring

 - When using the `prefilter' option, smoother plots were omitting the smoothed
   observables

 - In the rare case of entering and expression x as x^(alpha-1) with x being 0
   in steady state and alpha being a parameter equal to 2, the Jacobian was
   evaluating to 0 instead of 1

 - Setting the prior for shock correlations was failing if a lower bound was not
   explicitly specified

Announcement for Dynare 4.2.5 (on 2012-03-14)
=============================================

We are pleased to announce the release of Dynare 4.2.5.

This is a bugfix release.

The Windows package for the new release is already available for download at
the official Dynare website <http://www.dynare.org>. The Mac and Linux packages
should follow soon.

All users are strongly encouraged to upgrade.

The new release is compatible with MATLAB versions ranging from 7.0 (R14) to
7.14 (R2012a) and with GNU Octave versions ranging from 3.0 to 3.6.

Note that GNU Octave users under Windows will have to upgrade to GNU Octave
version 3.6.1 (MinGW). The Octave installer can be downloaded at:

 http://www.dynare.org/octave/Octave3.6.1_gcc4.6.2_20120303-setup.exe

Here is a non-exhaustive list of the problems identified in version 4.2.4 and
that have been fixed in version 4.2.5:

 * The MATLAB optimization toolbox was sometimes not correctly detected even
   when installed

 * Using the inverse gamma distribution with extreme hyperparameter values
   could lead to a crash

 * Various issues in the accelerated deterministic solver with block
   decomposition

 * Various issues in the parallelization engine

 * Compatibility issues with the Global Sensitivity Analysis toolbox

 * The Dynare++ binary was broken in the Windows package because of a missing
   dynamic library


Announcement for Dynare 4.2.4 (on 2011-12-02)
=============================================

We are pleased to announce the release of Dynare 4.2.4.

This is a bugfix release. It comes only a few days after the previous release,
because version 4.2.3 was affected by a critical bug (see below).

The Windows package for the new release is already available for download at
the official Dynare website <http://www.dynare.org>. The Mac and Linux packages
should follow soon.

All users are strongly encouraged to upgrade, especially those who have
installed the buggy 4.2.3 release.

The new release is compatible with MATLAB versions ranging from 7.0 (R14) to
7.13 (R2011b) and with GNU Octave versions ranging from 3.0 to 3.4.

Here is the list of the problems identified in version 4.2.3 and that have been
fixed in version 4.2.4:

 * Second order approximation was broken for most models, giving incorrect
   results (this problem only affects version 4.2.3, not previous versions)

 * Bayesian priors with inverse gamma distribution and very small variances
   were giving incorrect results in some cases

 * The `model_diagnostics' command was broken


Announcement for Dynare 4.2.3 (on 2011-11-30)
=============================================

We are pleased to announce the release of Dynare 4.2.3.

This is a bugfix release.

The Windows package is already available for download at the official
Dynare website <http://www.dynare.org>. The Mac and Linux packages
should follow soon.

All users are strongly encouraged to upgrade.

This release is compatible with MATLAB versions ranging from 7.0 (R14)
to 7.13 (R2011b) and with GNU Octave versions ranging from 3.0 to 3.4.

Here is a non-exhaustive list of the problems identified in version 4.2.2 and
that have been fixed in version 4.2.3:

 * `steady_state_model' was broken for lags higher than 2

 * `simult_.m' was not working correctly with `order=3' if `k_order_solver' had
   not been explicitly specified

 * `stoch_simul' with `order=3' and without `periods' option was reporting
   dummy theoretical moments

 * Under Octave, option `solve_algo=0' was causing crashes in `check' and
   `stoch_simul'

 * Identification module was broken

 * The test for singularity in the model reporting eigenvalues close to 0/0 was
   sometimes reporting false positives

 * The `conditional_variance_decomposition' option was not working if one
   period index was 0. Now, Dynare reports an error if the periods are not
   strictly positive.

 * Second order approximation was buggy if one variable was not present at the
   current period


Announcement for Dynare 4.2.2 (on 2011-10-04)
=============================================

We are pleased to announce the release of Dynare 4.2.2.

This is a bugfix release.

The Windows package is already available for download at the official
Dynare website <http://www.dynare.org>. The Mac and Linux packages
should follow soon.

All users are strongly encouraged to upgrade.

This release is compatible with MATLAB versions ranging from 7.0 (R14)
to 7.13 (R2011b) and with GNU Octave versions ranging from 3.0 to 3.4.

Here is a list of the problems identified in version 4.2.1 and that have
been fixed in version 4.2.2:

 * The secondary rank test following the order test of the Blanchard and
   Kahn condition was faulty and almost never triggered

 * The variance prior for BVAR “à la Sims” with only one lag was
   inconsistent.  The solution implemented consists of adding one extra
   observation in the presample used to compute the prior; as a
   consequence, the numerical results for all estimations will be
   slightly different in future releases (thanks to Marek Jarociński for
   spotting this)

 * The `conditional_forecast' command was buggy: it was always using the
   posterior mode, whatever the value of the `parameter_set' option

 * `STEADY_STATE' was not working correctly with certain types of
   expressions (the priority of the addition and substraction operators
   was incorrectly handled)

 * With the `block' option of `model', the preprocessor was failing on
   expressions of the form "a^b" (with no endogenous in "a" but an
   endogenous in "b")

 * Some native MATLAB statements were not correctly passed on to MATLAB
   (e.g.  x = { 'foo' 'bar' } )

 * `external_function' was crashing in some circumstances

 * The lambda parameter for HP filter was restricted to integer values
   for no good reason

 * The `load_mh_file' option of `estimation' was crashing under Octave
   for Windows (MinGW version)

 * Computation of steady state was failing on model contains auxiliary
   variables created by leads or lags larger than 2 or by of the
   `EXPECTATION' operator

 * Compilation of MEX files for MATLAB was failing with GCC 4.6


Announcement for Dynare 4.2.1 (on 2011-05-24)
=============================================

We are pleased to announce the release of Dynare 4.2.1.

Many bugs have been fixed since the previous release. The reference
manual has also been improved: new contents has been added at various
places, the structure has been improved, an index of functions and
variables has been added, the PDF/HTML rendering has been improved.

The Windows package is already available for download at the official
Dynare website [1]. The Mac and Linux packages should follow soon.

All users are strongly encouraged to upgrade.

This release is compatible with MATLAB versions ranging from 7.0 (R14)
to 7.12 (R2011a) and with GNU Octave versions ranging from 3.0 to 3.4.

Here is a list of the main bugfixes since version 4.2.0:

 * The `STEADY_STATE' operator has been fixed

 * Problems with MATLAB 7.3 (R2006b) and older have been fixed

 * The `partial_information' option of `stoch_simul' has been fixed

 * Option `conditional_variance_decomposition' of `stoch_simul' and
   `estimation' has been fixed

 * Automatic detrending now works in conjunction with the `EXPECTATION'
   operator

 * Percentage signs inside strings in MATLAB statements (like disp('%
   This is not a comment %')) now work

 * Beta prior with a very small standard deviation now work even if you
   do not have the MATLAB Statistical toolbox

 * External functions can now been used in assignment of model local
   variables

 * `identification' command has been fixed

 * Option `cova_compute' of `estimation' command has been fixed

 * Random crashes with 3rd order approximation without `use_dll' option
   have been eliminated

Announcement for Dynare 4.2.0 (on 2011-02-15)
=============================================

We are pleased to announce the release of Dynare 4.2.0.

This major release adds new features and fixes various bugs.

The Windows package is already available for download. The Mac and Linux
packages should follow soon.

All users are strongly encouraged to upgrade.

This release is compatible with MATLAB versions ranging from 6.5 (R13) to 7.11
(R2010b) and with GNU Octave versions 3.0.x and 3.2.x (support for GNU Octave
3.4.x is not complete and will be added in the next minor release).

Here is the list of major user-visible changes:

* New solution algorithms:

  - Pruning for second order simulations has been added, as described in Kim,
    Kim, Schaumburg and Sims (2008) [1,2]

  - Models under partial information can be solved, as in Pearlman, Currie and
    Levine (1986) [3,4]

  - New nonlinear solvers for faster deterministic simulations and steady state
    computation [5]

* Dynare can now use the power of multi-core computers or of a cluster of
  computer using parallelization [6]

* New features in the user interface:

  - A steady state file can now be automatically generated, provided that the
    model can be solved analytically, and that the steady state as a function
    of the parameters is declared with the new "steady_state_model" command [7]

  - For non-stationary models, Dynare is now able of automatically removing
    trends in all the equations: the user writes the equations in
    non-stationary form and declares the deflator of each variable. Then Dynare
    perform a check to determine if the proposed deflators are compatible with
    balanced growth path, and, if yes, then it computes the detrended equations
    [8]

  - It is now possible to use arbitrary functions in the model block [9]

* Other minor changes to the user interface:

  - New primitives allowed in model block: normpdf(), erf()

  - New syntax for DSGE-VAR [10]

  - Syntax of deterministic shocks has changed: after the values keyword,
    arbitrary expressions must be enclosed within parentheses (but numeric
    constants are still accepted as is)

* Various improvements:

  - Third order simulations now work without the "USE_DLL" option:
    installing a C++ compiler is no longer necessary for 3rd order

  - The HP filter works for empirical moments (previously it was only available
    for theoretical moments)

  - "ramsey_policy" now displays the planner objective value function under
    Ramsey policy and stores it in "oo_.planner_objective_value"

  - Estimation: if the "selected_variables_only" option is present, then the
    smoother will only be run on variables listed just after the estimation
    command

  - Estimation: in the "shocks" block, it is now possible to calibrate
    measurement errors on endogenous variables (using the same keywords than
    for calibrating variance/covariance matrix of exogenous shocks)

  - It is possibile to choose the parameter set for shock decomposition [11]

  - The diffuse filter now works under Octave

  - New option "console" on the Dynare command-line: use it when running Dynare
    from the console, it will replace graphical waitbars by text waitbars for
    long computations

  - Steady option "solve_algo=0" (uses fsolve()) now works under Octave

* For Emacs users:

   - New Dynare mode for Emacs editor (contributed by Yannick Kalantzis)

   - Reference manual now available in Info format (distributed with
     Debian/Ubuntu packages)

* Miscellaneous:

   - Deterministic models: leads and lags of two or more on endogenous
     variables are now substituted by auxiliary variables; exogenous variables
     are left as is [12]

    available at 3rd order)
